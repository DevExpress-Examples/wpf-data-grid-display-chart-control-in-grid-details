# Displaying chart control in grid details


<p>This example demonstrates how to display a memo field and a chart within grid details.

This is done by assigning the same template to the detail descriptors' ContentTemplate properties. Note that when using a DataControlDetailDescriptor, the template is displayed above the detail grid.</p><p>Two grid control are included in this sample to demonstrate how to setup custom details both via XAML or code.</p>
